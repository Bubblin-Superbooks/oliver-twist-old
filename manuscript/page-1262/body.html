<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.</p><p>'Help!' shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.</p><p>'He's here! Break down the door!'</p><p>'In the King's name,' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder.</p><p>'Break down the door!' screamed the boy. 'I tell you they'll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!'</p></div> </div>
