Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.

These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.</p></div> </div>
